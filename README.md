# Interactive Power BI Dashboard using DAX Formula

Excited to share my latest project in Power BI! ðŸŒŸ

I recently completed my second interactive Power BI dashboard project, and it has been an incredible learning journey! Hereâ€™s what I accomplished:

âœ… Mastered DAX calculations including:

MTD (Month-to-Date), QTD (Quarter-to-Date), and YTD (Year-to-Date) functions.

Same Period Last Year DAX Function for comparative analysis.

DAX Queries to create meaningful insights.


âœ… Designed a visually appealing and highly interactive dashboard that showcases:

Sales performance across cities and brands.

Trends by month, day, and year.

Payment methods and customer ratings insights.


The process involved transforming data into actionable insights and leveraging the full potential of Power BI to make data-driven decisions easier and more effective.

ðŸ“Š These dashboards are perfect for understanding sales patterns, identifying growth opportunities, and enhancing business strategies.

ðŸ”— Open to feedback and excited to explore more opportunities in data visualization and business intelligence!
